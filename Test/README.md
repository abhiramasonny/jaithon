# Test Directory

This directory contains test applications to run with my programming language

## Usage
To use these applications made with Jaithon, run the interpreter with
```shell
./jaithon
```
<br>
Then put Test/filename as input for the filename to interpret.
<br>
For example:
```shell
Test/Jaithon/greatest
```
This would execute the greatest application.

### Python
The directory Python contains the equivalent code written in the Python programming language. By comparing the code you can see how my language is vastly superior *jk* and simpler than python. Also I do know that same-line if statements are supported by python, but the average beginner wouldn't know that.
